# Data Structure & Algorithm
- Data Structure are different ways of organizing data on you computer that can be used effectively
- Algorithm is set of instructions to perform a task

## What makes a good algorithm?
- Correctness
- Efficiency

## Types of Data Structure
1. Primitive (usually in-built by langauge)
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Character
    - Boolean
2. Non Primitive (usually user-built)
    1. Linear (Data is stored in linear sequential order)
        1. Static
            - Array
        2. Dynamic
            - Linked List
            - Stack
            - Queue
    2. Non Linear (Data is stored in non-linear order)
        - Tree
        - Graph

## Types of Algorithm
- Searching algorithm
- Sorting algorithm
- Brute Force algorithm
- Simple recursive algorithm
- Divide and Conquer algorithm
- Dynamic Programming algorithm
- Greedy algorithm
- Randomized algorithm
